    The layman looks at a graphical interface to interact with their computers and never stops to question the development behind it. When I found out that computers only fundamentally use simple 0s and 1s, I was astonished and my curiosity in computational theory began to heighten. My first experience while coding was in high school where I learned to code in Java. Building my first few programs using Java gave me a glimpse into the infinite abyss of possibilities that could be attained through programming. I saw that programming was effective because it turns a simple task into a complex one. They are incredible at making processes more productive and efficient. Using Visual Studio Code, I created a rudimentary video game and a website. From building these programs I found that at the element of programming, true understanding, mathematics is fundamental. During that period, I realized that if I wanted to learn more I needed to dedicate my time to computing and mathematics which is what motivated me to apply for Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University.

    Throughout my time at Texas A&M University, I have attended and hosted computer science lectures. Through these lectures, I learned about how people make sense of the world through science. It was through classwork that I realized that there were indecipherable problems that still haven't been solved. These problems seemed to be solvable through automation and simulation with future computing capability. My desire is to bring that future into the present. I want to integrate software seamlessly into every part of our daily lives. I believe that the best software is the ones you don't notice are there.

    In recent years, I have had the fantastic opportunity to take part in many development projects ranging from web development to robotics to machine learning. Through these projects, I learned crucial software design principles and processes. I have worked as both a developer and a project lead on many teams. Agile development is something I am extremely familiar with and is my preferred methodology. These experiences are what make me who I am as a developer and are why I continue to grow as a software engineer. 
    
    <!-- One of the projects that I worked on, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR), was a project that used machine learning in order to upscale an image from a lower resolution to a higher one. I learned many things about computation the most key one being the development of neural nets. I enjoy working on projects like SISR because they give me a chance to explore my creative side as well as allowing me to further improve my problem-solving skills when something goes wrong. Throughout my years at Texas A&M I have taken many research projects (1-2 per year) finally ending up with a research position at ACE-lab TAMU which is where I research today. -->
