    The layman looks at a graphical interface to interact with their computers and never stops to question the development behind it. When I found out that computers only fundamentally use simple 0s and 1s, I was astonished and my curiosity in computational theory began to heighten. My first experience while coding was in high school where I learned to code in Java. Building my first few programs using Java gave me a glimpse into the infinite abyss of possibilities that could be attained through programming. I saw that programming was effective because it turns a simple task into a complex one. They are incredible at making processes more productive and efficient. Using Visual Studio Code, I created a rudimentary video game and a website. From building these programs I found that at the element of programming, true understanding, mathematics is fundamental. During that period, I realized that if I wanted to learn more I needed to dedicate my time to computing and mathematics which is what motivated me to apply for Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University.

    Throughout my time at Texas A&M University, I have both attended and hosted lectures about computer science. Through these lectures, I learned about how people make sense of the world through science. It was though classwork that I realized that there were indecipherable problems that still haven't been solved. These problems seemed to be solvable through automation and simulation with future computing capability. My desire is to bring that future into the present. For a long time, computing has been set according to Mooreâ€™s Law; the number of transistors doubles every two years. I am determined to find alternative means of creating computational power.

    One of the projects that I worked on, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR), was a project that used machine learning in order to upscale an image from a lower resolution to a higher one. I learned many things about computation the most key one being the development of neural nets. I enjoy working on projects like SISR because they give me a chance to explore my creative side as well as allowing me to further improve my problem-solving skills when something goes wrong. Throughout my years at Texas A&M I have taken many research projects (1-2 per year) finally ending up with a research position at ACE-lab TAMU which is where I research today.

        P stands for polynomial time. NP stands for non-deterministic polynomial time. Does the set P of problems equal the set NP of problems?
